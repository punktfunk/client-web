//! The browser client's console host (`design/web-client-implementation-plan.md` WP0.2): the
//! same `pf_console_ui::Console` every other client draws, on Skia's GL backend over a WebGL2
//! canvas.
//!
//! The page owns the loop. `requestAnimationFrame` in `web/index.html` calls [`pf_frame`], which
//! is the whole pacing story for this tier (`web-client.md` §1: no presenter here) and keeps the
//! measurement of it — plan §5.3 — on the JavaScript side where it can be compared against the
//! browser's own timing.
//!
//! Rule R2 of the plan lives here as an absence: **this crate names no GL, WebGPU or browser
//! type**. The context comes up in `web/pf-glue.js` and is already current when [`pf_start`]
//! runs; Skia then assembles its interface over emscripten's GL entry points. Video, when it
//! arrives in Phase 2, lands on the *other* canvas and never crosses into this heap (R3), which
//! is what makes the WebGPU swap a change to that one JavaScript file.
