//! [`Transport`] over WebTransport datagrams (`design/web-client-implementation-plan.md` §3).
//!
//! The hot path gets a ring, not an allocation. At roughly 4–5k datagrams a second for a 50 Mbps
//! stream, a `Vec` per packet is garbage the collector on the other side of the boundary has to
//! chase. Instead Rust owns a fixed ring of slots, hands JavaScript a pointer into wasm memory,
//! and JavaScript writes each datagram straight in with `HEAPU8.set`. One memcpy, no allocation,
//! nothing per-packet for either runtime to free.
//!
//! Two copies happen in total — JS into the ring, ring into the caller's buffer in
//! [`Transport::recv_batch`] — because the trait hands out caller-owned buffers. That is the
//! shape core's session pump wants, and neither copy allocates.
//!
//! Single-threaded by construction: emscripten runs this on one thread, and every entry point
//! here is called from it. The ring therefore lives in a `thread_local` behind `RefCell`, and the
//! [`Transport`] implementor is a zero-sized handle — which is what makes `Send + Sync` honest
//! rather than an `unsafe impl` promising something the platform cannot break anyway.
