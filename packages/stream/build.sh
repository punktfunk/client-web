# 🛑 This is the ONE target where we build Skia instead of downloading it, and it is not a
# packaging oversight. rust-skia's published wasm archives — 0.99.0 and 0.153.2 alike — are
# compiled for EMSCRIPTEN exception handling, while Rust's `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` std has
# used WASM exception handling since 1.87. The two cannot be linked: with the prebuilt the link
# ends in `undefined symbol: emscripten_longjmp`, and stripping rustc's `-fwasm-exceptions` to
# meet it halfway ends in `undefined symbol: __cpp_exception` from libstd instead. `EMCC_CFLAGS`
# below is what puts Skia on Rust's side of that line.
#
# The cost is paid once per machine: the result is packed into an archive under the cache below,
# and every later build downloads that instead — the same `SKIA_BINARIES_URL` mechanism the webOS
# armv7 client uses for its self-hosted archive. Delete the cache to force a rebuild.

# binary. tsdown keeps that chunk separate; the `.wasm` is copied beside it into `dist/` by the
# `build:lib` step's postbuild below, so a consumer's bundler sees the same relative layout.
